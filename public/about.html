<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a college student, junior, at WGU earning my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. <br/>
  I am also a student in the London App Brewery Full Stack Web Developer Course. </p>

<p>I started building websites when I was 12 years old in 1996. I spent hours learning html.<br/>
It wasn't until I was older that I realized I could make a career out of my passion,<br/>
 and thus began my journey. Going back to college to earn my degree was only a peice<br/>
of the puzzle and why I began the Full Stack Web Developer Course. </p>

<p>I am CompTIA A+ Certified and ITIL Certified.</p>
