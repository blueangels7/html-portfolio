<h1>The Best Movies According to Khristen</h1>
<p>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2> 
</p>
<hr />
       <h3>Alice in Wonderland</h3>
           <p>This has been my favorite movie for as long <br />
            as I can remember. I love the thought of being<br/>
            lost in Wonderland.</p>

       <h3>Sucker Punch</h3>
           <p>This movie gives me chills, the soundtrack<br />
           is amazing, the visuals are insane. It is gritty and<br>
            beautiful at the same time.</p>
           
       <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
           <p>This was my first introduction to Studeio Gihbli <br />
           and has sent me down a path of loving all things<br />
           Japanese.</p>
